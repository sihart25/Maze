# Maze
The aim of this assessment was to produce a program to walk through and render a three dimensional maze in real time. The program was to be written in C or C++ using the OpenGL library. The pattern of the maze was to be defined by a text file, and movement through the maze, using the cursor keys, was to obey collision detection rules. Spinning objects were to be placed in the maze, and the scene was to be rendered using perspective projection, lighting and smooth shading. All the required features have been implemented. Aerial, player, inset and cross-eyed stereo views, opening and closing solid walls, objects for collection, textures, sounds, monsters, and movement using the mouse, have been added as extra features.
